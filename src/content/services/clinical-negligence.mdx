Confidential and Expert help.

If you, or a member of your family have been unfortunate enough to have received substandard medical care or treatment by your doctor, hospital or dentist and have been left with injuries that could have been avoided then we can help you.

You may have been wrongly diagnosed, not diagnosed at all, or not warned properly about the side effects of treatment. Medical Negligence can cause distress to both victim and their family. Many clinical errors can lead to life changing injuries and illnesses.

We provide a confidential and sympathetic service and we try to make investigating the case as easy as possible. We provide a free initial meeting to discuss your case and we provide a fixed fee investigation service.

From the initial, no obligation consultation, we will investigate your claim, assessing the circumstances surrounding the incident and collecting relevant evidence to support your claim.

## A Comprehensive and Personal service

### Initial meeting

We can hold an initial meeting without charge, either in person or over the telephone, to discuss the circumstances of your potential claim and advise on the prospects of succeeding as well as the practical steps to be taken including funding your claim. We offer a fixed fee investigation as well as no win no fee agreements and we can apply for insurance cover on your behalf.

### Fixed Fee Investigation

The next step would be for us to obtain detailed evidence from you and from other sources regarding the circumstances that gave rise to your injuries and the nature of those injuries. This can take a number of months depending on the complexity of the case and includes carrying out a compete assessment of your medical records. We then review the case and discuss our findings and recommendations with you.

### Expert Evidence

Clinical Negligence Cases require expert evidence very early on and the independent expert instructed will provide evidence addressing the standard of care you received and the effects of any failures in the standard of that care.

### Next Steps

Depending on the outcome of our initial investigations and expert evidence we are required to comply with the Clinical Negligence Pre-Action Protocol, under which we would set out the basis of your claim and the injuries you have suffered to the defendant hospital or doctor. We will be with you each step of the way guiding you through this procedure and through the court process if necessary and will consider at each stage whether your claim is capable of settlement.

If you have been injured as a result of someone else's negligence, whether in a road traffic accident, at work, in a public place, or through substandard medical treatment, you may be entitled to compensation. At Windeatts, our litigation team has extensive experience in handling personal injury and clinical negligence claims, and we are committed to securing the best possible outcome for every client.

## Personal Injury Claims

Personal injury claims arise in a wide variety of circumstances. We regularly act for clients who have been injured in road traffic accidents, workplace accidents, slips and trips in public places, and incidents involving defective products. Whatever the cause of your injury, we will investigate the circumstances, gather the necessary evidence, and pursue your claim robustly on your behalf.

Compensation in personal injury cases can cover a wide range of losses, including pain and suffering, loss of earnings, medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, travel costs, and care and assistance provided by family members. In more serious cases involving long-term or permanent disability, we will instruct specialist medical experts and forensic accountants to ensure that your claim reflects the full extent of your losses, both now and in the future.

## Clinical Negligence

Clinical negligence claims arise where a healthcare professional, whether a GP, hospital consultant, surgeon, dentist, or other practitioner, provides treatment that falls below the standard reasonably expected of a competent professional, and the patient suffers harm as a result. These cases can be medically and legally complex, and they require solicitors with specialist knowledge and experience.

Our team handles a broad range of clinical negligence claims, including surgical errors, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, medication errors, birth injuries, and failures in care. We work with leading independent medical experts to establish whether the treatment you received was negligent and to assess the impact of any harm you have suffered.

## Funding Your Claim

We understand that the cost of legal action can be a significant concern. In many personal injury and clinical negligence cases, we are able to offer no-win, no-fee arrangements, formally known as Conditional Fee Agreements. This means that you will not be required to pay our legal fees unless your claim is successful. We will discuss funding options with you at the outset and ensure that you understand the financial implications before you commit to proceeding.

## The Claims Process

From your first consultation, we will provide an honest assessment of the merits of your claim and the likely timescale for resolution. Most personal injury claims are resolved through negotiation and settlement without the need for a court hearing, but where a fair settlement cannot be achieved, we are fully prepared to take your case to trial. Throughout the process, we will keep you informed of developments and ensure that you are involved in all key decisions.

## Rehabilitation and Support

We recognise that compensation is only part of the picture. Where appropriate, we will help you to access early rehabilitation, including physiotherapy, counselling, and occupational therapy, to support your recovery. Our aim is not just to secure financial compensation but to help you rebuild your life after an injury. Contact our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes for a confidential initial discussion of your case.

Protecting your wealth and ensuring that as much as possible passes to your chosen beneficiaries requires careful planning. At Windeatts, our private client team provides expert advice on trust creation, inheritance tax planning, and wealth preservation strategies, helping individuals and families across Devon make the most of their assets for future generations.

## Understanding Inheritance Tax

Inheritance tax (IHT) is charged at 40% on the value of an estate above the nil-rate band, which currently stands at 325,000 pounds per person. An additional residence nil-rate band may be available where you leave your main home to direct descendants. While these allowances mean that many estates fall below the threshold, rising property values in the South Hams and across Devon mean that an increasing number of families are affected by IHT.

Our solicitors will review your estate, identify potential IHT liabilities, and advise on legitimate strategies to reduce the tax burden. These may include making lifetime gifts, using your annual exemptions, establishing trusts, making charitable donations, or restructuring the ownership of your assets. Every situation is different, and we will recommend an approach that is proportionate to your circumstances and goals.

## Trusts

A trust is a legal arrangement in which assets are held by trustees for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries. Trusts can be used for a wide range of purposes, including protecting assets for vulnerable beneficiaries, providing for minor children or grandchildren, managing the succession of family businesses, and reducing exposure to inheritance tax.

We advise on and draft all types of trusts, including discretionary trusts, life interest trusts, bare trusts, and will trusts. We also act as professional trustees where clients require an independent, experienced trustee to manage the trust on an ongoing basis. Our team can guide you through the tax implications of establishing and operating a trust, including the ten-year anniversary charges and exit charges that apply to certain trust structures.

## Ongoing Trust Administration

Once a trust has been established, it requires proper administration to remain compliant with the law. Trustees have a range of duties and obligations, including maintaining accurate records, filing trust tax returns, and making distributions in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. We provide comprehensive trust administration services, supporting both lay and professional trustees with their responsibilities.

## Agricultural and Business Property Relief

For clients who own farms, agricultural land, or trading businesses, agricultural property relief and business property relief can significantly reduce or eliminate the inheritance tax payable on these assets. The rules governing these reliefs are detailed and complex, and specialist advice is essential to ensure that they are properly claimed. Our private client team has extensive experience advising farming families and business owners across Devon and the South West.

## A Tailored Approach

Tax planning is not a one-size-fits-all exercise. We take the time to understand your family, your assets, and your objectives before recommending a strategy. Our goal is to help you achieve a balance between enjoying your wealth during your lifetime and preserving it for the people and causes that matter most to you.

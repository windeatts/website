Buying a property with another person, whether a partner, family member, or friend, is an increasingly common way to get onto the property ladder or invest in bricks and mortar. However, co-ownership brings with it important legal questions that need to be addressed at the outset to protect everyone involved. At Windeatts, our property team provides clear, practical advice to ensure that your co-ownership arrangement is properly documented and legally sound.

## Joint Tenants or Tenants in Common

One of the most important decisions you will make when buying a property together is how you hold the legal title. As joint tenants, you each own the whole property equally, and if one owner dies, the property automatically passes to the survivor regardless of what any will says. As tenants in common, you each own a defined share of the property, which can be equal or unequal, and your share forms part of your estate when you die. We will explain the implications of each option and help you choose the arrangement that best suits your circumstances.

## Declarations of Trust

Where co-owners are contributing different amounts to the purchase price, or where you wish to record specific arrangements about how costs and responsibilities are shared, a declaration of trust is essential. This document sets out each person's share in the property, what happens if one person wants to sell, how mortgage payments and outgoings are divided, and what happens if the relationship breaks down or one party wishes to exit the arrangement.

Our solicitors draft bespoke declarations of trust tailored to your specific situation. Whether you are an unmarried couple pooling resources, parents helping a child onto the housing ladder, or friends investing together, we will ensure that the agreement reflects your intentions and protects your respective interests.

## When Things Change

Circumstances change over time. A co-owner may wish to sell their share, a relationship may end, or one party may want to buy the other out. We can advise on the legal process for dealing with these situations, including serving notices, negotiating buyouts, and, if necessary, applying to the court for an order for sale. Where disputes arise, our litigation team can assist with resolving matters as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible.

## Protecting Your Investment

Without proper legal documentation, disputes about property ownership can be costly and distressing. We strongly recommend that all co-owners put a formal agreement in place at the time of purchase. The cost of preparing a declaration of trust is modest compared with the expense and uncertainty of litigating a dispute years down the line. Our team at Windeatts will guide you through the process and ensure that your investment is properly protected from day one.

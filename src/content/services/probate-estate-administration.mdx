Losing a loved one is an incredibly difficult time, and dealing with their legal and financial affairs can feel overwhelming. At Windeatts, our private client team provides compassionate, professional support to executors and administrators throughout the probate process. We have been helping families in the South Hams and across Devon with estate administration for generations, and we understand the sensitivity that these matters require.

## What Is Probate?

Probate is the legal process of dealing with someone's estate after they have died. If the deceased left a valid will, the executors named in it will usually need to apply for a Grant of Probate, which gives them the legal authority to collect in the assets, pay any debts and liabilities, and distribute the estate to the beneficiaries. If there is no will, the rules of intestacy determine who is entitled to inherit, and an application must be made for a Grant of Letters of Administration.

## How We Can Help

Our team can assist with every aspect of estate administration, or we can provide guidance on specific steps if you prefer to handle some elements yourself. Our services include:

- Advising on the validity of the will and identifying the beneficiaries
- Preparing the application for the Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration
- Valuing the estate for probate and inheritance tax purposes
- Completing and submitting the necessary HM Revenue & Customs forms
- Collecting in the assets of the estate, including property, bank accounts, investments, and personal effects
- Settling outstanding debts, taxes, and liabilities
- Preparing estate accounts and distributing the estate to the beneficiaries

## Inheritance Tax

Where an estate is subject to inheritance tax, we work closely with our specialist tax advisers to ensure that all available reliefs and exemptions are claimed, minimising the tax liability on the estate. We can also advise on the interaction between inheritance tax and any trusts that the deceased may have established during their lifetime.

## Contested Estates

Regrettably, disputes sometimes arise during the administration of an estate, whether over the validity of a will, the interpretation of its terms, or claims by individuals who feel they have not been adequately provided for. Our litigation team has considerable experience in handling contentious probate matters and can advise executors and beneficiaries on their rights and options.

## Sensitive and Personal Service

We recognise that every estate is different, and we tailor our approach to the needs of each client. Whether the estate is straightforward or complex, we will guide you through the process step by step, keeping you informed and ensuring that the administration is completed as efficiently as possible. Our offices in Kingsbridge and Totnes are welcoming and accessible, and we are always happy to arrange home visits for clients who are unable to travel.

None of us likes to think about a time when we may no longer be able to manage our own affairs, but putting the right legal arrangements in place now can provide invaluable peace of mind for you and your family. At Windeatts, our private client team helps individuals and families across the South Hams plan for the future with clear, considered advice on wills, Lasting Powers of Attorney, and advance decisions.

## Wills

A properly drafted will is the foundation of any estate plan. It ensures that your assets pass to the people you choose, in the way you choose, and can help to minimise the inheritance tax payable on your estate. Without a will, the rules of intestacy dictate who inherits, and the result may not reflect your wishes at all.

Our solicitors will take the time to understand your family circumstances, your assets, and your wishes before drafting a will that is tailored to your needs. Whether your requirements are straightforward or you need a more complex arrangement involving trusts, guardianship provisions for minor children, or specific legacies, we will provide clear advice and ensure that your will is properly executed and stored safely.

## Lasting Powers of Attorney

A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is a legal document that allows you to appoint one or more trusted individuals to make decisions on your behalf if you lose the capacity to do so yourself. There are two types: a Property and Financial Affairs LPA, which covers decisions about your finances, property, and investments; and a Health and Welfare LPA, which covers decisions about your medical treatment, care arrangements, and daily living.

We strongly recommend that everyone considers putting LPAs in place, regardless of age. If you lose mental capacity without an LPA, your family may need to apply to the Court of Protection for a deputyship order, which is a significantly more expensive and time-consuming process. Our team will guide you through the LPA process, help you choose appropriate attorneys, and ensure that the documents are correctly completed and registered with the Office of the Public Guardian.

## Advance Decisions

An advance decision, sometimes called a living will, allows you to set out your wishes regarding medical treatment in the event that you are unable to communicate them yourself. This can cover specific treatments that you do or do not wish to receive, and can provide valuable guidance to your family and medical professionals at a difficult time.

## Regular Reviews

Life changes, and your estate plan should change with it. We recommend reviewing your will and LPAs whenever there is a significant change in your circumstances, such as marriage, divorce, the birth of a child or grandchild, a change in your financial position, or a change in the tax rules. Our team is always available to discuss whether your arrangements remain appropriate and to make any necessary updates.

## Taking the First Step

Many people put off planning for the future because they find the subject uncomfortable or assume it is only something they need to think about later in life. In reality, the best time to put these arrangements in place is now, when you have the capacity and the opportunity to make considered decisions. Contact our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes to arrange a consultation with one of our private client solicitors.

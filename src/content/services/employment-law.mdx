Employment law affects every business, regardless of size or sector, and the rules governing the relationship between employers and employees are detailed and constantly evolving. At Windeatts, our litigation team provides clear, practical employment law advice to businesses and individuals across the South Hams and Devon, helping you to manage workplace issues effectively and avoid costly disputes.

## Advice for Employers

Running a business means managing people, and getting employment matters right is essential to protecting your business and maintaining a productive, motivated workforce. We advise employers on a wide range of issues, including:

- Drafting and reviewing employment contracts and staff handbooks
- Managing disciplinary and grievance procedures
- Handling redundancy programmes, including consultation obligations and selection criteria
- Advising on the legal implications of restructuring and reorganisation
- Managing sickness absence and capability issues
- Ensuring compliance with discrimination legislation, including the Equality Act 2010
- Advising on settlement agreements and exit negotiations

We understand that employment issues often need to be dealt with quickly and sensitively. Our team is available to provide prompt, pragmatic advice when you need it, whether by telephone, email, or in person at our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes.

## Advice for Employees

If you are facing a problem at work, whether you have been unfairly dismissed, made redundant, discriminated against, or subjected to bullying or harassment, it is important to get legal advice early. We can help you to understand your rights, explore your options, and, where appropriate, negotiate a fair settlement with your employer.

We also advise employees on the terms of their employment contracts, restrictive covenants, and settlement agreements that they have been asked to sign. If you have been offered a settlement agreement, your employer is required by law to pay for you to receive independent legal advice on its terms, and we can provide this service quickly and efficiently.

## Employment Tribunal Claims

Where a workplace dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation or the ACAS Early Conciliation process, it may be necessary to bring or defend a claim in the Employment Tribunal. We have experience in handling a wide range of tribunal claims, including unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, discrimination, whistleblowing, and claims for unpaid wages or holiday pay.

Employment Tribunal proceedings have strict time limits, and it is essential to act promptly if you are considering a claim. In most cases, you must contact ACAS within three months of the event you are complaining about. We will ensure that your claim is brought in time and prepared thoroughly.

## TUPE Transfers

When a business or part of a business is transferred to a new owner, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations protect the rights of affected employees. We advise both transferring and incoming employers on their obligations under TUPE, including the duty to inform and consult, the automatic transfer of employment terms, and the limited circumstances in which changes to terms and conditions may be permissible.

## Proactive HR Support

The best way to avoid employment disputes is to get things right from the start. We offer proactive HR support to businesses, including reviewing and updating employment documentation, delivering training on key topics such as disciplinary procedures and equality law, and providing an ongoing advisory service for day-to-day HR queries.

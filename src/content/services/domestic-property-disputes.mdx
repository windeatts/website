Swift and straightforward solutions.

## Disputes about the ownership and occupation of a property can take on many different forms.

But whether the property is occupied as your home, owned as an investment or occupied by a business, a common factor is that property disputes are usually a source of great stress and unhappiness, and unless tackled the problem rarely goes away.

Many property disputes can be narrowed down to questions of legal rights and duties so good advice early on will almost certainly save you time and money.

We are committed to finding practical and cost-effective solutions for you. Fiona Hughes specialises in property litigation, is fully qualified, and employs her broad range of knowledge and experience to explain the issues and give you an independent and objective view on your situation. She will then carefully guide you step by step through the legal process of asserting your property rights and resolving your dispute.

Our advice is helpful and easy to understand. It can often be given over the telephone, without the need for a face to face meeting if you wish. We will also give you full information about the likely costs and provide regular updates.

Contact us for a free initial consultation to look at the options available to you.

Whether you are purchasing your first home in Kingsbridge, selling a family property in Totnes, or relocating to the South Hams, our experienced conveyancing team is here to make the process as smooth and straightforward as possible. At Windeatts, we have been helping clients buy and sell property across Devon since 1832, and we understand that moving home is one of the most significant financial decisions you will ever make.

## Our Conveyancing Services

Our property team handles every aspect of the conveyancing process on your behalf. For buyers, this includes conducting thorough searches, reviewing the contract pack provided by the seller's solicitor, raising enquiries, reporting to your mortgage lender, and ensuring that all legal formalities are completed ahead of exchange and completion. For sellers, we prepare the contract pack, respond to the buyer's solicitor's enquiries, and manage the process through to a successful completion.

We act on a wide range of residential transactions, from straightforward freehold sales and purchases to more complex matters involving leasehold properties, new-build developments, shared ownership schemes, and Help to Buy arrangements. Whatever your circumstances, we will provide clear, practical advice at every stage.

## What to Expect

From your first instruction, you will be assigned a dedicated conveyancer who will be your main point of contact throughout the transaction. We pride ourselves on keeping you informed at every step, providing regular updates by telephone, email, or letter according to your preference. We will explain any legal jargon in plain English and ensure you understand the implications of any issues that arise during the process.

We recognise that property transactions can be stressful, particularly when you are part of a chain. Our team works proactively to keep matters moving, liaising with estate agents, mortgage brokers, and other solicitors to resolve issues promptly and avoid unnecessary delays.

## Transparent Fees

We believe in being upfront about our costs. At the outset of your matter, we will provide you with a detailed estimate of our fees and the disbursements you can expect to pay, including Land Registry fees, search fees, and Stamp Duty Land Tax. There are no hidden charges, and if your circumstances change during the transaction, we will discuss any impact on costs with you immediately.

## Why Choose Windeatts

With offices in both Kingsbridge and Totnes, we are ideally placed to assist with property transactions across the South Hams, South Devon, and beyond. Our conveyancers have extensive local knowledge and established relationships with estate agents, mortgage brokers, and surveyors throughout the region. Combined with nearly two centuries of legal expertise, this means you can trust us to handle your move with professionalism and care.

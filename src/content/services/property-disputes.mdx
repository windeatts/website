Property disputes can be stressful, disruptive, and costly if not handled properly. Whether you are dealing with a boundary disagreement with a neighbour, a dispute over a right of way, a conflict between landlord and tenant, or a more complex issue involving land registration or development, the litigation team at Windeatts has the experience and expertise to help you find a resolution.

## Boundary Disputes

Boundary disputes are among the most common property disagreements we encounter. They can arise from something as simple as the position of a garden fence or wall, or they may involve more complex questions about the legal boundary as shown on the title plan, the interpretation of old conveyances, or the effect of long-established physical features. We can advise on the evidence needed to establish the correct boundary, negotiate with the other party on your behalf, and, where necessary, pursue or defend proceedings in the court or before the Land Registry.

## Rights of Way and Easements

Disputes about rights of way, access, drainage, and other easements are common in rural areas like the South Hams, where properties often share drives, tracks, and paths. We advise on whether a right of way or easement exists, the extent of the rights it confers, and what can be done if someone is interfering with your rights or claiming rights over your land. We also assist with applications to modify or extinguish rights of way, and with disputes arising under the law of prescription and adverse possession.

## Landlord and Tenant Disputes

Disagreements between landlords and tenants can arise over a wide range of issues, including rent arrears, disrepair, service charges, lease interpretation, forfeiture, and the renewal or termination of a tenancy. We act for both landlords and tenants in these disputes, and our combined expertise in property law and litigation means that we can provide joined-up advice that covers both the transactional and the contentious aspects of the matter.

## Adverse Possession

Adverse possession, sometimes referred to colloquially as squatters' rights, is the legal principle by which a person may acquire ownership of land through long, continuous, and undisputed occupation. The rules differ depending on whether the land is registered or unregistered, and the law in this area was significantly changed by the Land Registration Act 2002. We advise both claimants and landowners on adverse possession claims, including applications to the Land Registry.

## Neighbour Disputes

Beyond boundary issues, disputes between neighbours can involve noise, nuisance, overhanging trees, party wall matters, and the impact of building works. These disputes can be deeply personal and can escalate quickly if not managed carefully. We take a pragmatic approach, seeking to resolve matters by negotiation wherever possible, but we are fully prepared to take court action when it is in our client's best interests to do so.

## Professional and Proportionate

Property disputes can be emotionally charged, and it is important to keep the costs proportionate to what is at stake. We will always give you an honest assessment of your case and the likely costs of pursuing or defending it, and we will recommend the most appropriate course of action, whether that is negotiation, mediation, or litigation. If court proceedings are necessary, we will manage your case efficiently and work to achieve the best possible outcome.

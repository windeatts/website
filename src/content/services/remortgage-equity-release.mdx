Clearly explained and quickly completed.

There are many reasons why you may choose to mortgage or remortgage your home.

You may wish to release capital or equity so you can carry out home improvements, or you may simply want to switch to a more favourable rate or flexible terms with a new lender.

If you are looking to remortgage we can recommend a suitably qualified Independent Financial Advisor to help you find the best deal, and once you have an offer, we will take care of all the legal technicalities. As a part of the process we'll explain the terms of the mortgage so you won't have any nasty surprises later on.

The process is usually quite straightforward and we will work to a competitive fixed fee. We are on the panel of all the major lenders so we are familiar with their procedures and can deal with all their requirements quickly. We also have the latest online access to Local Authorities, the Land Registry and other search companies.

Equity Release Mortgages are becoming increasingly popular with retired homeowners. As with a standard remortgage, most people use them to release capital in what is usually their main asset. However it is vital that specialist legal advice is taken because your entitlement to some state benefits could be affected as could your tax position. In addition, Equity Release Mortgages will reduce the value of your estate and it may be necessary to review your Will. We will guide you carefully through the process.

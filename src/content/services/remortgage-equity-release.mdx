Whether you are looking to secure a better mortgage deal, raise capital for home improvements, or release equity from your property in retirement, our property team at Windeatts can handle the legal side of things efficiently and at a competitive cost. We act for clients across the South Hams and wider Devon on all types of remortgage and equity release transactions.

## Remortgage

Remortgaging involves switching your existing mortgage to a new lender, or taking out a new mortgage product with your current lender. There are many reasons you might wish to remortgage: to take advantage of a lower interest rate, to consolidate debts, to raise additional funds, or simply because your current fixed-rate or discounted deal is coming to an end.

Our solicitors will handle all the legal work required by your new lender, including carrying out the necessary searches, reviewing the mortgage offer, and ensuring that the new mortgage is properly registered at the Land Registry. We work with all major high street lenders and building societies, and we are on the approved panel of most UK mortgage providers.

## Equity Release

Equity release schemes allow homeowners aged 55 and over to access the value tied up in their property without having to move. The most common type is a lifetime mortgage, where you borrow against the value of your home and the loan is repaid when the property is eventually sold, typically when you move into long-term care or pass away.

Equity release is a significant financial decision with long-term implications, and it is a legal requirement that you receive independent legal advice before proceeding. Our solicitors will explain the terms of the equity release plan in detail, ensure you understand the impact on your estate and any inheritance you wish to leave, and confirm that you are entering into the arrangement freely and with full knowledge of its consequences.

## A Straightforward Process

We understand that remortgage and equity release transactions need to be completed promptly, particularly where you are switching lenders and your existing deal is about to expire. Our team works efficiently to ensure that matters are progressed without unnecessary delay, and we keep you informed throughout so that you always know where things stand.

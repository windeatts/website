Helping elderly clients and their families.

## Advice you can trust

Sometimes good advice can make all the difference. You want to do what's best, but it can be hard to know what that is.

Talking to a trusted and independent advisor can help to clarify what you are hoping to achieve, and the best way to do it.

Whether you are wanting to make or update your Will, are worried about paying for a care home or struggling with your paperwork, we'll take time to listen and then clearly explain what your options are and how we can help. We promise that we will always concentrate on your needs, and we will never try to sell you a service or product that you don't want.

We are fully regulated and have strict professional standards. Our offices have convenient and easy to access meeting rooms or alternatively we can visit you at home. You'll receive a friendly welcome and enough time to talk through whatever is on your mind. And we'll always let you know what our services will cost before you are committed to pay anything.

## Our areas of expertise

**Wills, Powers of Attorney and Living Wills**: As you might expect we offer a full range of legal documents to help put your affairs in order.

**Financial management**: We can deal with the day to day running of your bank accounts and savings where you find it hard to cope and do not have a relative or friend with the time or expertise to help

**Court of Protection**: Where a person does not have a Will or Power of Attorney in place, and no longer has the understanding to draw one up, we can help to sort things out

**Family home**: Whether it is buying, selling or re-mortgaging, we can guide you through the process. We can also help with 'equity release' or 'lifetime mortgages'

**Care Home fees**: If you or someone you know may need to move into a care home, we can tell you how your contribution towards fees will be assessed and the best way to order your finances. We can also help you to claim fully funded NHS care if you think you should be eligible

**Inheritance Tax**: We can help you to understand your potential liability to Inheritance Tax and help you to arrange your property and affairs in the most tax-efficient way (please see separate leaflet)

**Gifts**: If you want to make a gift of cash, savings or property, we can help you to think through all the implications and deal with the paperwork

Growing older brings its own set of legal challenges, from planning for potential care needs to managing affairs when health declines. At Windeatts, we have a long tradition of providing thoughtful, personalised legal services to older clients and their families across the South Hams and wider Devon. We understand the issues you face and are committed to helping you navigate them with dignity and confidence.

## Care Home Fees and Funding

The cost of residential and nursing care can be substantial, and understanding how care is funded is essential for proper planning. Local authorities carry out financial assessments to determine whether an individual is eligible for funding, and the rules around what assets are taken into account, including your home, can be complex.

Our solicitors can advise you on the local authority assessment process, the current capital thresholds, and the options available to you for managing or mitigating the impact of care fees on your estate. Where appropriate, we can also help with challenges to local authority funding decisions and with arrangements such as deferred payment agreements.

## Court of Protection and Deputyship

If a family member has lost mental capacity without having put a Lasting Power of Attorney in place, it may be necessary to apply to the Court of Protection for a deputyship order. This gives the appointed deputy the legal authority to manage the person's finances, property, or welfare decisions on their behalf.

The deputyship application process can be lengthy and requires detailed supporting evidence. Our team has considerable experience in preparing these applications and can guide you through every step, from obtaining the necessary medical evidence to attending court hearings where required. We also advise deputies on their ongoing duties, including the requirement to submit annual reports to the Office of the Public Guardian.

## Safeguarding and Vulnerable Adults

Sadly, older and vulnerable adults can be at risk of financial abuse, undue influence, or neglect. If you have concerns about the welfare or finances of an older person, we can provide confidential advice on the steps available to protect them, including applications to the Court of Protection, referrals to safeguarding authorities, and challenges to suspicious transactions.

## Home Visits and Accessible Services

We understand that many of our older clients may find it difficult to visit our offices. We are happy to arrange home visits, or visits to care homes and hospitals, wherever this would be more convenient. Our team takes the time to ensure that every client fully understands the advice they are given, and we are experienced in working with clients who may have hearing difficulties, visual impairments, or early cognitive decline.

## Planning Ahead

Many of the most difficult situations we encounter could have been avoided or significantly eased with proper advance planning. We work closely with our colleagues across the private client team to help older clients put wills, Lasting Powers of Attorney, and advance decisions in place while they are able to do so. If you or a family member would like to discuss any aspect of later-life planning, please do not hesitate to contact our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes.

Buying or selling a business is a major undertaking that involves complex legal, financial, and commercial considerations. Whether you are an entrepreneur acquiring your first business, an established company making a strategic acquisition, or a business owner looking to sell and move on, the team at Windeatts will guide you through every stage of the process with clear, practical advice.

## Asset Sales and Share Sales

There are two principal ways to buy or sell a business: through an asset sale, where the buyer acquires specific assets and liabilities of the business, or through a share sale, where the buyer purchases the shares in the company that owns the business. Each approach has different legal, tax, and commercial implications, and the right choice will depend on your particular circumstances.

Our solicitors will advise you on the most appropriate structure for your transaction, taking into account the nature of the business, the assets involved, any existing contracts or liabilities, and the tax consequences for both parties. We work closely with accountants and tax advisers to ensure that the transaction is structured in the most efficient way possible.

## Due Diligence

For buyers, thorough due diligence is essential to understanding what you are purchasing and identifying any risks or issues that could affect the value of the business. Our team will review the company's contracts, leases, employment arrangements, intellectual property, regulatory compliance, financial records, and any outstanding disputes or liabilities. We will report our findings to you clearly and advise on any issues that need to be addressed before or after completion.

## Sale and Purchase Agreements

The sale and purchase agreement is the central document in any business transaction. It sets out the terms of the deal, including the purchase price and how it is to be paid, the assets or shares being transferred, any conditions that must be satisfied before completion, and the warranties and indemnities given by the seller. Our solicitors draft and negotiate these agreements to protect your interests and ensure that the deal reflects what has been agreed commercially.

## Employee Matters

Where a business is being transferred as a going concern, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, commonly known as TUPE, will usually apply. These regulations protect employees by automatically transferring their employment from the seller to the buyer on their existing terms and conditions. We advise both buyers and sellers on their obligations under TUPE, including the requirement to inform and consult with affected employees.

## After Completion

The legal work does not end at completion. Post-completion matters may include registering the transfer of assets, notifying customers and suppliers, updating regulatory registrations, and dealing with any price adjustment mechanisms. We will ensure that all necessary steps are taken promptly and efficiently, so that you can focus on running your new business or enjoying the proceeds of your sale.

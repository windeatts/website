Whether you are acquiring new business premises, negotiating a commercial lease, developing land, or disposing of an investment property, the commercial property team at Windeatts provides clear, commercially focused legal advice to help you achieve your objectives. From our offices in Kingsbridge and Totnes, we act for businesses, developers, investors, and landowners across the South Hams and throughout Devon.

## Buying and Selling Commercial Property

Commercial property transactions involve a range of considerations that go beyond those encountered in residential conveyancing. Our team advises on the acquisition and disposal of all types of commercial property, including offices, retail premises, industrial units, agricultural land, and development sites. We conduct thorough due diligence, including title investigation, planning and environmental searches, and review of any existing leases or tenancies affecting the property.

We understand that commercial transactions are often time-sensitive and that delays can have significant financial consequences. Our solicitors work efficiently to progress matters to completion, coordinating with your accountants, surveyors, and other professional advisers as needed.

## Commercial Leases

Negotiating the terms of a commercial lease is one of the most important decisions a business can make. Whether you are a landlord granting a lease or a tenant taking one on, the terms you agree to will affect your business for years to come. Our team advises on all aspects of commercial leasing, including rent, rent review mechanisms, service charges, repair obligations, break clauses, and assignment and subletting provisions.

We also advise on lease renewals under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, including the procedures for both landlords and tenants, and the circumstances in which the court may order the grant of a new lease or permit a landlord to oppose renewal.

## Development and Planning

For developers and landowners, we provide legal support across the full lifecycle of a development project, from site acquisition and option agreements through to planning obligations, construction contracts, and the sale or letting of completed units. We work closely with planning consultants and other professionals to ensure that the legal framework supports your development objectives.

## Agricultural Property

The South Hams is home to a thriving agricultural community, and we have particular expertise in advising on transactions involving farms, agricultural land, and rural property. This includes sales and purchases, agricultural tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 and the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, diversification projects, and environmental stewardship agreements.

## Practical, Commercial Advice

Our approach is to provide practical, commercially aware advice that helps you make informed decisions and achieve your goals. We recognise that every transaction is different, and we tailor our service to the specific requirements of each client. Contact our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes to discuss your commercial property needs.

Commercial disputes are an inevitable part of doing business, and when they arise, you need solicitors who understand both the law and the commercial realities of your situation. At Windeatts, our litigation team acts for businesses and individuals across the South Hams and Devon in a wide range of contractual and commercial disputes, always with a focus on achieving the best practical outcome for our clients.

## Types of Dispute

Our team handles a broad spectrum of commercial litigation matters, including:

- Breach of contract claims, whether you are pursuing or defending a claim for non-performance, defective goods or services, or failure to pay
- Partnership and shareholder disputes, including claims for unfair prejudice, breach of fiduciary duty, and dissolution
- Professional negligence claims against accountants, surveyors, financial advisers, and other professionals
- Debt recovery, from initial demand through to enforcement of judgment
- Intellectual property disputes, including trade mark and copyright infringement
- Directors' duties and liabilities
- Supply chain disputes and agency agreements

Whatever the nature of your dispute, we will provide a frank assessment of the merits of your case, the likely costs and timescale, and the range of possible outcomes. We believe in giving honest, realistic advice so that you can make informed decisions about how to proceed.

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Litigation is not always the best way to resolve a commercial dispute. Court proceedings can be expensive, time-consuming, and damaging to business relationships. We are strong advocates of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), including mediation, arbitration, and expert determination, and we will always explore whether a negotiated settlement is achievable before recommending court action.

Mediation in particular has an excellent track record of resolving commercial disputes, and we regularly represent clients in mediation sessions. A skilled mediator can often help the parties to find a commercial solution that a court could not impose, and mediation is typically quicker and less costly than taking a case to trial.

## Court Proceedings

Where ADR is not appropriate or has been unsuccessful, we are fully prepared to pursue or defend your claim through the courts. Our solicitors have experience in all levels of the civil court system, from the County Court to the High Court, and we work with leading barristers when the case requires it. We will manage your case efficiently, comply with court deadlines and procedural requirements, and keep you informed at every stage.

## Costs and Funding

We understand that the cost of litigation is a major concern for businesses. At the outset of every case, we will provide a realistic costs estimate and discuss the funding options available to you, which may include hourly rate billing, fixed fees for specific stages of the work, or, in appropriate cases, conditional fee arrangements. We will also advise on the recovery of costs from the other side if your claim is successful.

## Acting Promptly

If you are involved in a commercial dispute, or if you believe that a dispute is likely to arise, it is important to take legal advice at the earliest opportunity. Prompt action can help to preserve evidence, protect your legal position, and improve the prospects of a favourable outcome. Contact our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes to arrange an initial consultation with one of our litigation solicitors.

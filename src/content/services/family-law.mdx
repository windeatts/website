When relationships break down, the legal issues that follow can feel overwhelming. At Windeatts, our family law team provides sensitive, practical advice to help you resolve matters as constructively as possible, whether through negotiation, mediation, or, where necessary, court proceedings. We have been supporting families across the South Hams and Devon through difficult times for many years, and we understand the emotional as well as the legal dimensions of every case.

## Divorce and Separation

If your marriage or civil partnership has broken down irretrievably, we can guide you through the divorce or dissolution process step by step. Following the introduction of no-fault divorce, it is now possible for couples to end their marriage without the need to apportion blame, and applications can be made jointly or by one party alone. We will explain the process, the timescales involved, and how the divorce interacts with financial matters and arrangements for children.

For couples who are not married, separation can raise its own set of legal issues, particularly around property ownership, financial provision, and parental responsibility. Our team can advise you on your rights and help you reach a fair resolution.

## Financial Settlements

Reaching a fair financial settlement on divorce or separation is often the most complex and contentious aspect of the process. The court has wide powers to divide assets, including the family home, pensions, savings, investments, and business interests. We will help you to understand what you are entitled to, gather the necessary financial disclosure, and negotiate a settlement that meets your needs and those of any children.

Where agreement cannot be reached through negotiation, we can represent you in Financial Remedy proceedings before the court. However, we always encourage clients to explore alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or collaborative law, as these can be quicker, less expensive, and less adversarial than contested court proceedings.

## Children Matters

The welfare of any children is always the court's paramount consideration, and it is ours too. We advise on all aspects of children law, including arrangements for where children will live, how much time they will spend with each parent, and specific issues such as schooling, holidays abroad, and relocation. We also advise on parental responsibility, including applications by unmarried fathers and step-parents.

Where parents are unable to agree on arrangements for their children, we can assist with mediation referrals or, if necessary, applications to the court for Child Arrangements Orders. Our solicitors are experienced in representing clients in private children proceedings and will always prioritise the best interests of the child.

## Domestic Abuse

If you or your children are at risk of domestic abuse, we can act swiftly to protect you. We advise on non-molestation orders, occupation orders, and other protective measures, and we can make emergency applications to the court where the situation demands it. We work with local support services and refuges to ensure that you have access to the practical help you need.

## A Constructive Approach

We believe that family law matters are best resolved with a minimum of conflict and a focus on the future. Our solicitors are trained in collaborative law and are committed to helping you find solutions that work for your whole family. To discuss your situation in confidence, please contact our offices in Kingsbridge or Totnes.

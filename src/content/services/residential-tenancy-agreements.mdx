Whether you are a landlord letting out a single property or managing a portfolio of rental homes, or a tenant entering into a new tenancy, it is essential that the legal framework governing the arrangement is clear, fair, and compliant with the law. At Windeatts, our property team provides expert advice on residential tenancy agreements to landlords and tenants across the South Hams and Devon.

## Assured Shorthold Tenancies

The assured shorthold tenancy (AST) is the most common form of residential tenancy in England. It provides the tenant with security of tenure for the fixed term of the agreement, while giving the landlord the ability to recover possession at the end of the term through the proper legal process. However, the law governing ASTs is more complex than many landlords realise, and failure to comply with the detailed procedural requirements can have serious consequences, including the inability to recover possession when needed.

Our solicitors draft bespoke AST agreements that are tailored to the specific property and the circumstances of the tenancy, rather than relying on generic templates that may not adequately protect your interests. We ensure that the agreement complies with current legislation, including the requirements relating to deposits, prescribed information, Energy Performance Certificates, gas safety certificates, and the right to rent checks.

## Landlord Services

We provide a comprehensive range of legal services to residential landlords, including:

- Drafting and reviewing tenancy agreements
- Advising on deposit protection requirements and the prescribed information that must be provided to tenants
- Serving Section 21 and Section 8 notices for the recovery of possession
- Advising on rent increases and rent arrears
- Assisting with possession proceedings in the County Court
- Advising on landlord obligations, including repair, safety, and licensing requirements

The regulatory landscape for residential landlords is evolving rapidly, with significant changes to the rules on eviction, energy efficiency, and tenant protections either recently enacted or in the pipeline. We keep our landlord clients informed of developments that affect them and help them to stay on the right side of the law.

## Tenant Services

We also act for residential tenants who need advice on their rights under an existing tenancy or who are entering into a new one. We can review the terms of a proposed tenancy agreement, advise on your rights to have your deposit protected, and assist you if your landlord is seeking to evict you or is failing to meet their obligations in respect of repairs, safety, or the condition of the property.

## Houses in Multiple Occupation

If you are a landlord letting a property to multiple tenants who are not all part of the same household, the property may be classified as a house in multiple occupation (HMO) and subject to additional licensing and safety requirements. Failure to comply with HMO regulations can result in significant fines and rent repayment orders. We advise landlords on whether their property requires an HMO licence and what steps they need to take to ensure compliance.

Peace of mind.

If you wish to rent your residential property to tenants we can provide a full service including preparing the Tenancy Agreement, advising you on your legal obligations as a landlord and ensuring that your documentation is up to date and in place to protect both the Landlord and the Tenant.

We also manage protecting the deposit under a registered scheme, extend the original tenancy to a Statutory Periodic Tenancy where necessary.

We are also able to provide a full service when the tenancy comes to an end, including serving the correct Notices to Quit, and arranging for the deposit to be unprotected and returned. If court proceedings need to be commenced then our service extends to attending court and obtaining an order for possession and instructing bailiffs to attend, if necessary.

## Commercial property:

We are able to provide a full service for both landlords and tenants in relation to termination of a Lease, and lease renewals, including guiding you through court proceedings if necessary for the court to determine the Lease or confirm terms of a Lease renewal.

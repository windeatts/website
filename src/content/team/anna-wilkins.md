Anna is a Paralegal in the Property department at Windeatts, providing essential support to the conveyancing team at the Kingsbridge office. She joined the firm in 2021 after completing a law degree at the University of the West of England in Bristol. Anna has quickly established herself as a capable and organised member of the team, with a natural aptitude for the detailed work that conveyancing requires.

Anna assists with all stages of residential property transactions, from opening new matters and ordering searches through to preparing completion statements and dealing with post-completion formalities such as Stamp Duty Land Tax returns and Land Registry applications. She also handles remortgage files and is often the first point of contact for clients chasing updates on their transactions. Anna's friendly and efficient manner ensures that clients feel well looked after from start to finish.

Anna grew up in Dartmouth and is delighted to be building her legal career close to home. She is currently studying towards her CILEx qualifications with a view to progressing further in the profession. In her spare time, Anna enjoys paddleboarding on the River Dart and is an avid reader. She lives in Kingsbridge with friends.

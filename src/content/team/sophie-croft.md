Sophie is a Paralegal in the Litigation department at Windeatts, based at the Kingsbridge office. She joined the firm in 2022 having completed a law degree at the University of Exeter, where she graduated with upper second-class honours. Sophie provides essential support to the litigation team across a range of civil and commercial disputes.

Sophie's responsibilities include drafting correspondence, preparing court bundles and trial documents, conducting legal research, and managing case files to ensure that key deadlines and court directions are met. She also assists with employment law matters, helping to prepare tribunal claim forms, response documents, and schedules of loss. Sophie is meticulous in her work and has developed a strong understanding of court procedures and the Civil Procedure Rules during her time with the firm.

Sophie grew up in Modbury and attended school locally before moving to Exeter for her studies. She returned to the South Hams after graduating, keen to build her career in the area she knows and loves. Sophie is currently studying for the Solicitors Qualifying Examination and hopes to qualify as a solicitor in the coming years. In her spare time, she enjoys horse riding in the Devon countryside and is a volunteer at a local animal rescue centre.

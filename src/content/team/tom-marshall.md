Tom is a Paralegal in the Private Client department, working from the Totnes office. He graduated from the University of Plymouth in 2022 with an honours degree in law and joined Windeatts shortly afterwards. Tom provides vital support to the department's solicitors and legal executives, assisting with probate applications, estate administration, and the preparation of wills and powers of attorney.

Tom's day-to-day work involves drafting documents, liaising with banks and financial institutions to gather asset information for estates, preparing probate applications for the Probate Registry, and helping to ensure that estate accounts are accurate and comprehensive. He also assists clients with the registration of lasting powers of attorney with the Office of the Public Guardian. Tom approaches his work with care and sensitivity, understanding that clients in this area of law are often going through difficult personal circumstances.

Tom is originally from Buckfastleigh and knows the Totnes area well. He is keen to pursue a career in private client law and is currently working towards his Solicitors Qualifying Examination. Outside of work, Tom plays guitar in a local band and enjoys hiking on Dartmoor. He volunteers with a local youth mentoring scheme and is passionate about making legal services accessible to everyone in the community.

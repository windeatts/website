Simon joined Windeatts in 2022 and works in the Totnes office. Simon is an experienced solicitor who has recently decided to develop his expertise in freehold and leasehold residential conveyancing with a view to broadening his experience in all kinds of property transactions.

Simon is personable and enjoys meeting clients to discuss any issues that may arise during the course of a transaction. Graduating and training in the north-west, Simon worked at a number of practices gaining a wealth of experience, before deciding to settle in the south-west in 2005.

When not in the office Simon enjoys making the most of his time outdoors with friends or family and can often be seen out on his bike or on the waves or simply on foot making the most of the beautiful scenery.

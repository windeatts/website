Oliver is a Trainee Solicitor at Windeatts, currently completing a seat in the Property department at the Totnes office. He graduated from the University of Exeter in 2023 with a first-class honours degree in law and was awarded the university's prize for the highest mark in Land Law. Oliver completed the Solicitors Qualifying Examination before joining the firm to begin his training in 2024.

As a trainee, Oliver is gaining hands-on experience across a range of residential conveyancing matters under the supervision of the department's experienced solicitors and legal executives. He assists with drafting contracts, reviewing title documents, conducting searches, and corresponding with clients and other solicitors. Oliver has already impressed the team with his enthusiasm, his willingness to learn, and the quality of his written work. Over the course of his training contract, Oliver will complete seats across the firm's three departments to gain a broad foundation in legal practice.

Oliver is from Ivybridge and has always had strong ties to the South Devon area. He chose to train at Windeatts because of the firm's reputation for providing excellent training and its deep roots in the local community. Outside of work, Oliver is a keen cyclist and regularly rides the lanes and hills around Dartmoor. He also plays five-a-side football with friends and enjoys cooking for his housemates.

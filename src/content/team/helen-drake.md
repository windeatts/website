Helen is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives and a valued member of the Private Client team at Windeatts. She has worked at the firm for over fifteen years, having joined in 2010 after completing her CILEx qualifications while working at a solicitors' practice in Newton Abbot. Helen's long tenure at the firm means she is well known to many of our regular clients and their families.

Helen specialises in probate and estate administration, guiding executors and administrators through the often complex process of dealing with a loved one's estate. She handles applications for grants of probate and letters of administration, the collection and distribution of assets, and the preparation of estate accounts. Helen also assists clients with the preparation of wills and lasting powers of attorney, ensuring that their wishes are clearly recorded and legally sound.

Helen has lived in the South Hams all her life and has a genuine affection for the area and its people. She is a familiar presence at the Kingsbridge office and is known for her warm, reassuring manner, which is particularly appreciated by clients who are dealing with bereavement. Outside of work, Helen is a keen member of a local choir and enjoys baking for village events. She lives in Stokenham with her husband and two teenage children.

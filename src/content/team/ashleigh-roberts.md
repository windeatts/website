Ashleigh joined Windeatts in 2022 and works in the Totnes and Kingsbridge offices. After completing her law degree, Ashleigh took a break to raise her family and then came back into the legal sector to undertake a graduate apprenticeship.

In her spare time, Ashleigh enjoys riding her horse, playing for Kingsbridge Ladies Rugby Team, spending lots of time at the beach with her children and when there is time, she likes to draw!

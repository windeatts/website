Richard is the Head of Property at Windeatts and has been a partner at the firm since 2005. He qualified as a solicitor in 1998 after studying law at the University of Exeter and completing his training contract with a leading regional practice in Plymouth. With over twenty-five years of experience in residential and commercial property law, Richard brings a depth of knowledge and a meticulous eye for detail to every transaction he handles.

Richard's practice covers the full spectrum of property work, from straightforward residential conveyancing through to complex commercial acquisitions, business sales, and equity release arrangements. He has particular expertise in agricultural property matters and rural estates, reflecting the unique character of the South Hams. He also advises on co-ownership agreements, helping clients navigate the legal considerations of purchasing property together.

Born and raised in Kingsbridge, Richard has a deep connection to the local community and is a familiar face at the firm's offices. Outside of work, he is an active member of the Kingsbridge Estuary Rotary Club and enjoys sailing in the waters around Salcombe and the South Devon coast. He lives near Kingsbridge with his family and their two spaniels.

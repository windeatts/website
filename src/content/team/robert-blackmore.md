Robert is a Legal Executive in the Property department, based at the firm's Totnes office. He qualified as a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives in 2012 after undertaking his professional training alongside full-time employment. Robert has worked in residential conveyancing for over twelve years and has a thorough, methodical approach that ensures transactions proceed smoothly from instruction through to completion.

Robert handles a busy caseload of residential sales, purchases, remortgages, and transfers of equity. He has particular experience with leasehold properties and new-build developments, and is well accustomed to working within tight timescales to meet exchange deadlines. Robert is also experienced in equity release matters, helping older homeowners to access the value in their property while continuing to live in their home. He works closely with lenders and financial advisers to ensure that all legal requirements are met.

Robert grew up in Paignton and has spent his entire career in the South Devon area. He is a reliable and dedicated member of the team, and clients regularly comment on his responsiveness and attention to detail. In his free time, Robert is a devoted follower of Torquay United and coaches a junior football team at weekends. He lives just outside Totnes with his partner and their dog.

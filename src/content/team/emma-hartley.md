Emma joined Windeatts in 2016 and is an Associate Solicitor in the Property department. She graduated from the University of Plymouth with a first-class degree in law and completed her training contract with the firm, qualifying in 2014. Emma has developed a strong residential conveyancing practice and is known for her approachable manner and her ability to explain the legal process in clear, straightforward terms.

Emma handles all aspects of residential property transactions, including freehold and leasehold sales and purchases, remortgages, transfers of equity, and shared ownership schemes. She has a particular interest in first-time buyer work and takes great care to guide clients who are new to the conveyancing process through each step with patience and clarity. Emma also advises on co-ownership matters, helping couples and friends who are buying together to put proper legal arrangements in place.

A Kingsbridge local, Emma attended Kingsbridge Community College before heading to Plymouth for her studies. She is a member of the Devon and Somerset Law Society and sits on its Junior Lawyers Committee. Outside of work, Emma is a keen runner and has completed several half-marathons in aid of local charities. She lives in Kingsbridge with her partner and their young daughter.

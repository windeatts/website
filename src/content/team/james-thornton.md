James is the Head of Litigation at Windeatts and has been a partner at the firm since 2012. He studied law at Cardiff University and undertook his training contract at a commercial practice in Bristol, qualifying as a solicitor in 2004. James relocated to Devon shortly after qualification and has built a strong reputation across the region for his tenacious yet pragmatic approach to dispute resolution.

James handles a broad range of contentious matters, including contract and commercial disputes, employment law issues, and property-related litigation such as boundary disputes, rights of way, and landlord and tenant disagreements. He is experienced in representing clients at all levels of court, from the County Court through to the High Court, and is also a trained mediator, enabling him to guide clients towards cost-effective settlements where appropriate. His employment law practice covers both employer and employee work, including unfair dismissal, redundancy, discrimination, and settlement agreements.

Originally from Taunton, James has made South Devon his home and is now based at the firm's Totnes office. He is an active supporter of local rugby, regularly seen on the touchline at Totnes RFC, and enjoys sea fishing off the Devon coast. James lives in Dartmouth with his wife and three children.

David is an Associate Solicitor in the Private Client department, based primarily at the Totnes office. He graduated from the University of Exeter in 2011 with an honours degree in law and English, before completing his Legal Practice Course at the University of Law in Bristol. David trained with a respected firm in Torquay and qualified in 2015, joining Windeatts the following year.

David's practice encompasses wills and estate planning, the administration of estates, lasting powers of attorney, and Court of Protection applications. He has developed a particular interest in advising elderly and vulnerable clients on planning for later life, including care fee planning and deputyship applications. David takes a sensitive and considered approach with every client, recognising that the matters he deals with are often deeply personal and can arise at difficult times.

David's family has been in the Totnes area for several generations, and he has a genuine understanding of the local community. He is a volunteer adviser at a local Citizens Advice bureau and a member of Solicitors for the Elderly. When not in the office, David is a keen cricketer, playing for his local village team during the summer months, and enjoys exploring Dartmoor on foot throughout the year.

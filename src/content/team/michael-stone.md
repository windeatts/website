Michael is an Associate Solicitor in the Property department, working primarily from the Totnes office. He studied law at the University of Leeds and completed his training contract in Manchester, qualifying in 2013. After several years practising commercial property law in the North West, Michael made the decision to relocate to Devon in 2019 and joined Windeatts shortly afterwards.

Michael's practice has a strong commercial focus. He advises on the acquisition, disposal, and leasing of commercial premises, as well as business sales and purchases. He regularly acts for local business owners, landlords, and developers, bringing an understanding of both the legal technicalities and the commercial realities of each transaction. Michael also handles residential conveyancing matters and is well versed in the particular challenges that can arise with older and listed properties, which are common in the South Hams area.

Michael made the move to Devon for the lifestyle and has embraced everything the region has to offer. He is an enthusiastic surfer and can often be found at Bantham Beach when conditions allow. He is also a member of the Totnes Chamber of Commerce and enjoys building relationships with the local business community. Michael lives in Totnes with his wife and their young son.

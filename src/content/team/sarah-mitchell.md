Sarah leads the Private Client department at Windeatts and has been a partner since 2010. She read law at the University of Bristol before training with a well-regarded firm in Exeter, qualifying in 2002. Sarah is a full member of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP), a mark of her specialist expertise in wills, trusts, probate, and tax planning.

Her practice focuses on helping individuals and families plan for the future with confidence. Sarah advises on the preparation of wills and lasting powers of attorney, the administration of estates of all sizes, and the establishment and management of trust funds. She has particular experience in inheritance tax planning and regularly works with clients to structure their affairs in a tax-efficient manner, often liaising closely with accountants and financial advisers to ensure a joined-up approach.

Sarah grew up in Totnes and returned to South Devon after qualifying, drawn back by the quality of life the area offers. She is a governor at a local primary school and volunteers with a Devon-based charity supporting older people. In her spare time, she enjoys walking the South West Coast Path with her family and is a keen gardener.

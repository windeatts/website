Louise is a Legal Executive in the Litigation department and has been with Windeatts since 2014. She obtained her CILEx qualifications in 2011 while working at a firm in Plymouth, where she gained broad experience in civil litigation. Louise became a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives in 2016 and has since developed a focused practice in contractual disputes and property-related litigation.

Louise handles a varied caseload that includes breach of contract claims, boundary and neighbour disputes, landlord and tenant matters, and debt recovery proceedings. She is adept at managing the procedural aspects of litigation and is experienced in preparing cases for trial, drafting witness statements, and dealing with disclosure. Louise takes a firm but measured approach, always keeping the client's best interests and the proportionality of costs at the forefront of her mind.

Louise is originally from Plymouth and moved to the South Hams to be closer to family. She is a dedicated member of the Kingsbridge office team and is often praised by clients for her clear communication and tenacity. Outside of work, Louise is a keen open-water swimmer and regularly takes part in sea swims along the South Devon coast. She lives in Chillington with her husband and their two young children.

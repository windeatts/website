Catherine is an Associate Solicitor in the Litigation department at Windeatts and has been with the firm since 2018. She studied law at the University of Southampton, graduating with upper second-class honours, and went on to complete her training contract with a mid-sized practice in Exeter. Catherine qualified as a solicitor in 2016 and spent two years gaining experience in general civil litigation before joining the team in Kingsbridge.

Catherine's caseload covers a wide range of civil disputes, including contractual disagreements, property disputes, professional negligence claims, and debt recovery. She is particularly skilled at assessing the merits of a case at an early stage and advising clients on the most proportionate course of action, whether that involves negotiation, mediation, or court proceedings. Catherine also assists James Thornton with the department's employment law work, handling matters such as grievance procedures, settlement agreements, and tribunal claims.

Catherine relocated to Devon from Hampshire and has quickly become an integral part of the local community. She is a trustee of a South Hams arts charity and enjoys the creative side of life outside of work, with a passion for pottery and printmaking. She lives near Salcombe with her husband and their two cats.

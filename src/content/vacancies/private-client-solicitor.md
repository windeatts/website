We are seeking a qualified Solicitor with solid Private Client experience to join our established Private Client department. A STEP qualification would be desirable but is not essential.

## Key Responsibilities

- Managing a varied caseload including wills, estate planning, probate and estate administration, lasting powers of attorney, trust administration, tax planning, and Court of Protection matters
- Providing high-quality, practical advice tailored to each client's individual circumstances
- Building long-term relationships with clients and their families
- Supporting the development and growth of the Private Client department
- Supervising and mentoring junior members of the team

## About You

You will be an experienced Private Client solicitor who takes pride in delivering a thorough, personal and professional service. You will have strong technical knowledge and excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex legal concepts in plain English. Experience across a range of Private Client work is preferred, and a STEP qualification would be a distinct advantage.

## Working Arrangements

Flexible and hybrid working arrangements are available for the right candidate. Part-time hours will also be considered.

## Benefits

- Competitive salary commensurate with experience
- Company pension scheme
- 24/7 Employee Assistance Programme
- Professional development and training support

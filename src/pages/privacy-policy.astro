      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information you provide primarily for the provision of legal services to you and
        for related purposes including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>updating and enhancing client records</li>
        <li>analysis to help us manage our practice</li>
        <li>statutory returns</li>
        <li>legal and regulatory compliance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our use of that information is subject to your instructions, data protection law and our duty
        of confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that our work for you may require us to pass on such information to third parties
        such as expert witnesses and other professional advisers, including sometimes advisers appointed
        by another party to your matter. We may also give such information to others who perform services
        for us, such as typing or photocopying. Our practice may be audited or checked by our accountants
        or our regulator, or by other organisations. We do not normally copy such information to anyone
        outside the European Economic Area, however we may do so when the particular circumstances
        of your matter so require. All such third parties are required to maintain confidentiality in
        relation to your files.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have a right of access under data protection law to the personal data that we hold about you.
        We seek to keep that personal data correct and up to date. You should let us know if you believe
        the information we hold about you needs to be corrected or updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have appointed the following person as our representative for the purposes of the Data
        Protection Act: <strong>Fiona Hughes</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Data Protection in Respect of Money Laundering Checks</h2>
      <p>
        We may receive personal data from you for the purposes of our money laundering checks, such as a
        copy of your passport. These will be processed only for the purposes of preventing money laundering
        and terrorist financing, or as otherwise permitted by law or with your express consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        You consent to us retaining such data for longer than the five year statutory period, unless you
        tell us otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Protection &mdash; Your Obligations</h2>
      <p>
        If you send us personal data about anyone other than yourself you will ensure you have any
        appropriate consents and notices in place to enable you to transfer that personal data to us, and
        so that we may use it for the purposes for which you provide it to us.

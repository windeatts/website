        We want to give you the best possible service. However, if at any point you become unhappy
        or concerned about the service we have provided then you should inform us immediately, so
        that we can do our best to resolve the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the first instance it may be helpful to contact the person who is working on your case to
        discuss your concerns and we will do our best to resolve any issues at this stage. If you
        would like to make a formal complaint, then you can read our full complaints procedure. Making
        a complaint will not affect how we handle your case.

      <h2>Solicitors Regulation Authority</h2>
      <p>
        The Solicitors Regulation Authority can help if you are concerned about the behaviour of your
        solicitor. This could be for things like dishonesty, taking or losing your money or treating
        you unfairly because of your age, a disability or other characteristic. You can raise your
        concerns with the
        <a href="https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/problems/report-solicitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solicitors Regulation Authority</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What to do if we cannot resolve your complaint</h2>
      <p>
        The Legal Ombudsman can help you if we are unable to resolve your complaint ourselves. They
        will look at your complaint independently and it will not affect how we handle your case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before accepting a complaint for investigation, the Legal Ombudsman will check that you have
        tried to resolve your complaint with us first. If you have, then you must take your complaint
        to the Legal Ombudsman:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Within six months of receiving a final response to your complaint</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No more than six years from the date of act/omission; or</li>
        <li>No more than three years from when you should reasonably have known there was cause for complaint.</li>
      </ul>

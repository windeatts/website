        Windeatts LLP is committed to providing a high-quality legal service to all our clients.
        When something goes wrong, we need you to tell us about it. This will help us to improve
        our standards.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Complaints Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a complaint about the service you have received, or about a bill, please
        contact us with the details. We have a procedure in place that sets out how we handle
        complaints.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Make a Complaint</h2>
      <p>In the first instance, please raise your concern with the solicitor or member of staff handling your matter. If you prefer, or if the matter is not resolved, please contact:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write to us at: Windeatts LLP, 20 Fore Street, Kingsbridge, Devon TQ7 1NY</li>
        <li>Email: <a href="mailto:law@windeatts.co.uk">law@windeatts.co.uk</a></li>
        <li>Telephone: <a href="tel:01548858947">01548 858947</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Will Happen Next</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>We will send you a letter acknowledging receipt of your complaint within three working days, enclosing a copy of this procedure.</li>
        <li>We will then investigate your complaint. This will normally involve the partner responsible for complaints reviewing your matter file and speaking with the member of staff who acted for you.</li>
        <li>The partner may invite you to a meeting to discuss and hopefully resolve your complaint. This is not compulsory and you may prefer to communicate in writing.</li>
        <li>We will send you a detailed written reply to your complaint within 21 days of receiving it, including any suggestions for resolving the matter.</li>
        <li>If you are still not satisfied, you may ask for the complaint to be reviewed by another partner.</li>
        <li>We will write to you within 14 days of receiving your request for a review, confirming our final position on your complaint and explaining our reasons.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Legal Ombudsman</h2>
      <p>
        If we are unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction, you may be able to refer
        it to the Legal Ombudsman. The Legal Ombudsman investigates complaints about the service
        provided by legal services providers. Before accepting a complaint, the Legal Ombudsman
        will check that you have tried to resolve your complaint with us first.
      </p>
      <p>You can contact the Legal Ombudsman:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit: <a href="https://www.legalombudsman.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.legalombudsman.org.uk</a></li>
        <li>Email: enquiries@legalombudsman.org.uk</li>
        <li>Telephone: 0300 555 0333</li>
        <li>Write to: Legal Ombudsman, PO Box 6167, Slough SL1 0EH</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ordinarily, you must refer your complaint to the Legal Ombudsman within six months of
        receiving our final written response and within one year of the act or omission about
        which you are complaining (or within one year of when you should reasonably have known
        there was cause for complaint).
      </p>

      <h2>Solicitors Regulation Authority</h2>
      <p>
        If you are concerned about our behaviour — for example, if you think we have been
        dishonest or treated you unfairly because of your age, disability or other characteristic
        — you can report your concerns to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).

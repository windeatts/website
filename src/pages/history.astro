        Windeatts is a leading law firm based in the South Hams District of Devon.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Believed to be originally based in Tavistock, the firm came to Totnes in 1832 and had its first
        office at 19 High Street, Totnes, a former Elizabethan Town House which the practice still
        occupies as one of its main office buildings.
      </p>

      <h2>The Windeatt Family</h2>
      <p>
        Successive generations of the Windeatt families became partners of the firm and were prominent
        in the life of Totnes and its surrounding district. The Windeatts family also acquired other
        prestigious titles, being, Clerks to the Borough and Rural District Councils and Clerks to the
        Magistrates. Three of their number were awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Totnes.
      </p>

      <h2>Expansion to Kingsbridge</h2>
      <p>
        In 1937 Col. Frank and Mr George Windeatt bought the solicitor's practice in Kingsbridge of the
        late Mr. B.N.O. Prettejohn from his executors.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time the office was in Melbourne Place, but in the early 1950's Windeatt and Windeatt, as
        we then were, moved to the first and second floor of our premises above 48 Fore Street, belonging
        to the late Mr Harold Harrison, a partner at the time. We incorporated the ground floor into the
        office in 1999.
      </p>

      <h2>The Modern Firm</h2>
      <p>
        There are no remaining members of the Windeatt family in the modern firm, the last member having
        died in 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practice expanded and occupied numbers 17 and 19 High Street and 5 and 6 Church Close, Totnes
        as its offices until September 2025 but has now moved to new offices at 58 - 60 Fore Street
        Totnes. We also have an office at 48 Fore Street in Kingsbridge.
      </p>

        Windeatts is one of the oldest solicitors' practices in Devon, with a proud history stretching
        back to 1832. For nearly two centuries, we have been providing trusted legal advice to individuals,
        families and businesses across the South Hams and beyond.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        The firm was established in 1832 in Kingsbridge, a thriving market town at the head of the
        Kingsbridge Estuary. From the outset, the practice served the local community — farmers,
        merchants and families who needed reliable legal counsel for their property transactions,
        business dealings and personal affairs.
      </p>

      <h2>Growth Through the Centuries</h2>
      <p>
        Through the Victorian era and into the twentieth century, the firm grew steadily, building
        a reputation for thorough, dependable legal work. As Kingsbridge and the surrounding area
        developed, Windeatts adapted to serve changing needs while maintaining the personal approach
        that had always defined the practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opening of our Totnes office marked an important step in the firm's development,
        extending our reach to serve clients across a wider area of South Devon. Totnes, with its
        vibrant community and thriving business scene, proved a natural fit for the firm's values.
      </p>

      <h2>A Modern Practice with Traditional Values</h2>
      <p>
        Today, Windeatts LLP operates from both Kingsbridge and Totnes with a team of experienced
        solicitors, legal executives and support staff. We offer a comprehensive range of legal
        services for individuals and businesses, from residential conveyancing and probate to
        commercial property and litigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While much has changed since 1832, our commitment to providing accessible, high-quality
        legal advice remains the same. We believe in building lasting relationships with our clients,
        understanding their needs and delivering practical solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>The South Hams</h2>
      <p>
        We are proud to be part of the South Hams community. The area's stunning coastline, rolling
        farmland and vibrant towns make it a wonderful place to live and work. Many of our team have
        deep roots in Devon, and we take genuine pleasure in helping our neighbours and fellow
        residents with their legal needs.
